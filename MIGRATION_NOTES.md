# MKZenith Repository Migration Notes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made during the repository rehabilitation process to modernize the development workflow, improve code quality, and enhance maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Development Environment
- Added `pyproject.toml` for modern Python project configuration
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for pre-commit hooks
- Added `.editorconfig` for consistent editor settings
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include development dependencies

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with:
  - Multi-version Python testing (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
  - Automated testing with coverage reporting
  - Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
  - Security scanning (bandit, safety)
  - Automated documentation deployment to GitHub Pages

### 3. Documentation
- Completely revamped `README.md` with:
  - Project badges
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Development guidelines
  - Contribution guidelines
- Added `DIAGNOSIS.md` with repository health assessment
- Set up automated documentation generation with MkDocs

### 4. Code Quality
- Added configuration for:
  - Black (code formatting)
  - isort (import sorting)
  - flake8 (linting)
  - mypy (static type checking)
  - bandit (security scanning)
  - safety (dependency vulnerability scanning)

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Developers
1. Update your local environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e '.[dev]'  # Install development dependencies
   pre-commit install  # Set up pre-commit hooks
   ```

2. Run the following to ensure your code meets the new standards:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   pytest --cov=./
   ```

### For New Developers
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e '.[dev]'
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Impact
- **Build System**: Now uses modern Python packaging standards with `pyproject.toml`
- **Dependencies**: Pinned versions with security scanning in CI
- **Code Quality**: Enforced through pre-commit hooks and CI checks
- **Documentation**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

## Known Issues
- The Codecov token needs to be added to GitHub Secrets for coverage reporting
- Some existing code might need updates to pass the new linters and type checkers

## Future Improvements
1. Add more comprehensive test coverage
2. Set up automated dependency updates with Dependabot
3. Add more detailed API documentation
4. Implement automated changelog generation

## Rollback Plan
To revert to the previous state:
1. Checkout the commit before the rehabilitation
2. Remove the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file
3. Remove the newly added configuration files:
   ```
   pyproject.toml
   .pre-commit-config.yaml
   .editorconfig
   DIAGNOSIS.md
   MIGRATION_NOTES.md
   ```
4. Restore the original `README.md` from the previous commit

## Support
For any issues during migration, please open an issue in the repository.
